# Introduction 

## Oracle Weblogic 

Oracle WebLogic Server provides a modern development platform for building applications, a runtime platform for high performance and availability, and rich management tooling for efficient and low cost operations.

The complete implementation of the WebLogic Server, of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 8 (Java EE 8) specification provides a standard set of APIs for creating distributed Java applications that can access a wide variety of services, such as databases, messaging services, and connections to external enterprise systems. End-user clients access these applications using web browser clients or Java clients. See Programming Models.

In addition to the Java EE implementation, WebLogic Server enables enterprises to deploy mission-critical applications in a robust, secure, highly available, and scalable environment. These features allow enterprises to configure clusters of WebLogic Server instances to distribute load, and provide extra capacity in case of hardware or other failures. New diagnostic tools allow system administrators to monitor and tune the performance of deployed applications and the WebLogic Server environment itself. You can also configure WebLogic Server to monitor and tune application throughput automatically without human intervention. Extensive security features protect access to services, keep enterprise data secure, and prevent malicious attacks.

### Oracle Helidon

Helidon SE is a compact toolkit that embraces the latest Java SE features: reactive streams, asynchronous and functional programming, and fluent-style APIs.

The REST framework for Helidon SE is the Helidon WebServer. Itâ€™s built on top of Netty and uses a straight forward request routing API.

Estimated Lab Time: 90 minutes

### Objectives
* To seamlessly integrate an application running on WebLogic  with a Helidon SE microservice
* Build a Helidon SE Microservice using Maven Archetype for Helidon
* Run a Helidon Microservice

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
* A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
* SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
