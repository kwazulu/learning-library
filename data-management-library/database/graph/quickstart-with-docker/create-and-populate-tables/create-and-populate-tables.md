# Create and Populate Database Tables

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the steps to create and populate database tables containing customer, account, purchase, and relationship data. You will then run some graph algorithms and queries and visualize the results in subsequent labs.

Estimated Lab Time: 2-3 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create and populate database tables
* Run graph algorithms and queries and visualize the results

### Prerequisites

* This lab assumes that you have successfully completed the lab - Setup Oracle Database in Docker

## **STEP 1:** Load the data

1. Connect to the database as "sys" user, and create a user, "customer_360".

    ```
    $ <copy> docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/Welcome1@localhost:1521/orclpdb1 as sysdba</copy>
    ```

2. At the SQL prompt enter:

    ```
    <copy>
    @/graphs/customer_360/create_user.sql
    EXIT
    </copy>
    ```

3. Connect to the database as the "customer_360" user, and create tables.

    ```
    $ <copy>docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus customer_360/Welcome1@localhost:1521/orclpdb1</copy>
    ```

4. At the SQL prompt enter:

    ```
    <copy>
    @/graphs/customer_360/create_tables.sql
    EXIT
    </copy>
    ```

You may now proceed to the next lab and create the graph.
