#  Analyze, Query, and Visualize Property Graphs in Oracle Database

## Introduction                                   

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to  deploy, configure, and use the Graph Server and Client package to query, analyze, and visualize graph content stored in a Free Tier Autonomous Database (ADB) instance. You will provision a new free tier ADB instance, load data into it, create a graph, and then query, analyze and visualize the graph.


### About Oracle Property Graph?
Oracle Database property graph supports and consists of graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.

## Workshop Objectives
In this workshop you will:
- Provision Free Tier Compute and ADB Shared instances.
- Deploy the Graph Server and Client package on the Linux compute instance you provisioned.
- Create and populate tables in the ADB instance.
- Query, analyze, and visualize that data as graphs.

## Lab Breakdown
- **Lab 1:** Generate the SSH keys you will need for accessing the compute.
- **Lab 2:** Provision a free tier ADB instance.
- **Lab 3:** Deploy the Graph Server and Client package on a compute instance.
- **Lab 4:** Create and enable a user in SQLDeveloper Web.
- **Lab 5:** Create and populate tables.
- **Lab 6:** Create the graph.
- **Lab 7:** Query and analyze the graph.
- **Lab 8:** Visualize graph query results.
