# Analyze Alerts and Audit Reports


## Introduction
This lab shows you how to view and analyze alerts, and audit data on your Autonomous Database with Oracle Data Safe.

**Note**: Your totals and data will be different than those shown in the screenshots.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you'll:

- Sign in to the Oracle Data Safe Console
- View and close alerts
- Analyze open alerts from the dashboard
- View all audit records for the past week
- View a summary of audit events collected and alerts raised
- Create a failed logins report

- Create two new filters to find out if the user `EVIL_RICH` is making any user entitlement changes.
  - To create the first filter, click **+ Filter**, and set the filter to be: **Alert = User Entitlement Changes**.
  - To create the second filter, click **+Filter**, and set the filter to be: **DB User = EVIL_RICH**.
  - Click **Apply**.

     ![Two filters for user EVIL_RICH](images/177425186.png)


- Review the alerts for `EVIL_RICH`.

- Click the **Alert ID** for the first alert. The Alert Details dialog box is displayed.

 ![Alerts for EVIL_RICH](images/177425201.png)


- Scroll down in the dialog box and review the SQL command. `EVIL_RICH` tried to execute the SQL command: `grant PDB_DBA to ATILLA`, but failed. Close the dialog box.

    ![Alert Details dialog box](images/177425210.png)


- Open the other **Alert IDs** for `EVIL_RICH`. Notice that the SQL text is similar in that the failed grants are for the `ATILLA` user.


- Suppose you take appropriate action. Now you can close the alerts. To do so, select the check box in the top left corner of the table to select all of the alerts displayed. From the **Mark As** menu, select **Closed**.

  ![Mark As > Closed](images/177425240.png)


- To hide closed alerts, move the **Open Alerts only** slider to the right.

## **STEP 3**: Analyze open alerts from the dashboard

- Click the **Home** tab.

- Review the information in the charts on the dashboard. Currently, there is no data for Security Assessment, User Assessment, Data Discovery, and Data Masking because you have not yet used those features.

    ![Dashboard](images/177408455.png)  

- In the **Open Alerts** chart, notice that the chart shows the number of open alerts for the last 7 days. Click the last node in the chart.

    ![Open Alerts chart](images/177408465.png)  


- In the **Open Alerts** dialog box, view the number of open alerts for the last 7 days.

  ![Open Alerts dialog box](images/177408484.png)  


- Hover over the counts to view the number of **Critical**, **High**, and **Medium** alerts for each day.


- Click the name of your target database to open the **All Alerts** report. The **All Alerts** report is filtered to show only the open alerts for your target database for the past 7 days.

## **STEP 5**: View a summary of audit events collected and alerts raised

- On the left, expand **Summary**, and then click **Audit Summary**. The **Audit Summary** report helps you to gain an understanding of the activity trends of your target databases. By default, the report shows you data for all of your target databases for the past week.

- View the totals to learn how many target databases are represented in the charts, how many users are audited, and how many client hosts have connected to your target database. The report is filtered to show data for the last week.

    ![Totals in Audit Summary report](images/177408621.png)  


- View the charts.

  - The **Open Alerts** chart compares the number of critical, high, and medium open alerts for the past week.
  - The **Admin Activity** chart compares the number of logins, database schema changes, audit setting changes, and entitlement changes for the past week.
  - The **Login Activity** chart compares the number of failed and successful logins for the past week.
  - The **All Activity** chart compares the total number of events for the past week.

  ![All Activity chart](images/177408629.png)  

- To filter the time period for the report, at the top, select **Last 1 Month**, and then click **Apply**.
