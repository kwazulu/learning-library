# Prerequisites for the Customer Tenancy

## Introduction

To complete the Oracle Data Safe labs in your own tenancy in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, you require access to an Oracle Data Safe environment. As a regular Oracle Cloud user, you do not have the necessary permissions in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to set up your own environment. The environment needs to be set up by your tenancy administrator.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes


### Objectives


In this lab, you'll:

- Request access to Oracle Data Safe in a region of your tenancy
- Sign in to a region of your tenancy by using your Oracle Cloud account credentials



### Prerequisites

Your tenancy administrator needs to set up an Oracle Data Safe environment for you before you can work through the labs in the Oracle Data Safe Workshop. After the environment is set up, you should have the following items:

- An Oracle Cloud account in your tenancy. The account can be a native or federated user account. Both are supported in Oracle Data Safe.
- A compartment in your tenancy created for or dedicated to you. During the labs, you create an Autonomous Database in the compartment and register it with Oracle Data Safe. By using your own compartment, the tenancy administrator can ensure that only you can access your database and save Oracle Data Safe resources to the compartment. In the labs, this compartment is referred to as "your compartment."
- Oracle Data Safe enabled in a region of your tenancy.
- Privileges to use all of the Oracle Data Safe features.



## **STEP 1** Request access to Oracle Data Safe in a region of your tenancy

- Send your email address to your tenancy administrator and request a user account in your tenancy.

- Send your tenancy administrator the instructions on how to set up an Oracle Data Safe environment for you. The instructions are [here]((set-up-oracle-data-safe-environment)).



## **STEP 2** Sign in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console by using your Oracle Cloud account credentials


- Access the Oracle email that was sent to you with the verification information for your user account. The email sender is [noreply@accountrecovery.oci.oraclecloud.com](../mailto:noreply@accountrecovery.oci./mailto:noreply@accountrecovery.oci..md). The email contains a link to the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Sign In** page as well as another link in case the first link does not work.




- Click the **Sign in to Oracle Cloud** link. The **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Sign In** page is displayed. Your tenancy name is already filled in for you.


- Under **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**, in the **USER NAME** field, enter your Oracle Cloud account credentials.


- In the **PASSWORD** field, enter your temporary password.


- Click **Sign In**.



- If this is the first time that you are signing in to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, you are prompted to change your password. Enter your temporary password and your new password, and then click **Sign In**. After you sign in, the Console Home page is displayed.
