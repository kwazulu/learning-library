# Set Up an Oracle Data Safe Environment

## Introduction

The following steps are intended for a tenancy administrator to set up an Oracle Data Safe environment for a regular Oracle Cloud user.



### Objectives
- Create a cloud account for a regular Oracle Cloud user
- Create a user group for Oracle Data Safe users
- Create or dedicate a compartment for a regular Oracle Cloud user
- Create a policy for the regular Oracle Cloud user that enables the user to manage the compartment
- Enable Oracle Data Safe in a region of your tenancy
- Grant all Oracle Data Safe privileges to the Oracle Data Safe user group


### Prerequisites
- A tenancy administrator account in your tenancy.

### Assumptions

- You are a tenancy administrator.





## **STEP 1:** Create an Oracle Cloud account for a regular Oracle Cloud user

The account can be native Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account or a federated user account. Both are supported in Oracle Data Safe.

- From the navigation menu, select **Identity**, and then **Users**.

  The **Users** page is displayed.

- If the tenancy uses federated user accounts, create the user account in the identity provider.
- Click **Create User**.
- Enter a short form name for regular Oracle Cloud user, for example, `dsu01`.
- Enter a user description, for example, **Data Safe user**.
- Enter the email address for the regular Oracle Cloud user.

  Oracle will send an email to this address with instructions on how to sign in to the tenancy.

- Click **Create**. The user account is listed on the **Users** page.
- Click the name of the user account. Details about the account are displayed. Notice that there is a **(Verification Pending)** message next to the email address.


## **STEP 2:** Create a user group for Oracle Data Safe users

- From the navigation menu, select **Identity**, and then **Groups**.

  The **Groups** page in IAM is displayed.

- Click **Create Group**.

  The **Create Group** dialog box is displayed.

- Enter a name for the group, for example, `dsg01` (short for Data Safe group 1)
- Enter a description for the group, for example, **Oracle Data Safe user group 1**.

  A description is required.

- (Optional) Create a tag.
- Click **Create**.

  The group is listed on the **Groups** page.

- Click the name of the group.
- Under **Group Members**, click **Add User to Group**.

  The **Add User to Group** dialog box is displayed.

- From the drop-down list, select the regular Oracle Cloud account that you created (for example, `dsu01`), and then click **Add**.

  The account is listed as a group member.



## **STEP 3:** Create or dedicate a compartment to a regular Oracle Cloud user



  - Sign in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using your Oracle Cloud credentials.
  - From the navigation menu, select **Identity**, and then **Compartments**.

    The Compartments page in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity and Access Management (IAM) is displayed.

  - Click **Create Compartment**.

    The **Create Compartment** dialog box is displayed.

  - Enter a name for the compartment, for example, `dsc01` (short for Data Safe compartment 1).
  - Enter a description for the compartment, for example, **Compartment1 for the Oracle Data Safe Workshop**.
  - Click **Create Compartment**.


## **STEP 4:** Create a policy for the regular Oracle Data Safe user

Create a policy in Oracle Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) that grants permissions to the group to which the Oracle Data Safe user belongs. The policy needs to allow the user to create and manage an Autonomous Data Warehouse database in the compartment.

- From the navigation menu, select **Identity**, and then **Policies**.

  The **Policies** page in IAM is displayed.

- Click **Policies**.

- Under **COMPARTMENT**, select the compartment created for the regular Oracle Cloud user.

- Click **Create Policy**.

  The **Create Policy** dialog box is displayed.

  - Enter a name for the policy. It is helpful to name the policy after the group to which the policy pertains, for example, `dsg01 `.

  - Enter a description for the policy, for example, **Policy for Data Safe group 1**.

  - For **Policy Versioning**, leave **KEEP POLICY CURRENT** selected.

  - In the **STATEMENT** field, enter the first policy statement:

    `allow group dsg01 to manage all-resources in compartment dsc01`

    If you are using a different compartment name than `dsc01`, change the name above to it.

  - Click **Create**.




## **STEP 5:** Enable Oracle Data Safe in a region of your tenancy

You can enable Oracle Data Safe in multiple regions of your tenancy, if needed. Be aware that you cannot disable Oracle Data Safe after it's enabled.

- From the navigation menu, select **Data Safe**.

  The **Overview** page is displayed.

- At the top of the page on the right, select the region in which you want to enable Oracle Data Safe, for example, **US East (Ashburn)**.
- Click **Enable Data Safe** and wait a couple of minutes for Oracle Data Safe to enable.

  When Oracle Data Safe is enabled, a confirmation message is displayed in the upper right corner.


## **STEP 6:** Grant all Oracle Data Safe privileges to the Oracle Data Safe user group

You can grant all Oracle Data Safe privileges to the Oracle Data Safe user group from the Oracle Data Safe Console.

- From the **Overview** page for Oracle Data Safe, click **Service Console** to access the Oracle Data Safe Console.

  As a tenancy administrator, you have all privileges in Oracle Data Safe.

- Click the **Security** tab.
- From the drop-down list, select the compartment for the regular Oracle Cloud user (for example, `dsc01`).
- Next to the user group that you created (for example, `dsg01`), select **Manage** from the **All Features** drop-down list.
- Click **Save**.

The regular Oracle Data Safe user can now access Oracle Data Safe.
