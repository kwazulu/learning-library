## Introduction
This lab shows you how to discover and mask sensitive data in Oracle Data Safe by using the Data Discovery and Data Masking features.

Estimated Lab Time: 30 minutes

### About Oracle Data Safe
Oracle Data Safe is a fully-integrated, regional Cloud service focused on the security of your data. It provides a complete and integrated set of features for protecting sensitive and regulated data in Oracle Cloud databases.

### Objectives

In this lab, you'll:

- View sensitive data in your Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) database
- Discover sensitive data by using Data Discovery
- Mask sensitive data by using Data Masking
- Validate the masked data in your ATP database


### Prerequisites

To complete this lab, you need to have the following:

- Login credentials for the Oracle Data Safe Console
- An Oracle Data Safe service enabled in a region of your tenancy
- A registered target database in Oracle Data Safe with sample audit data and the password for the `ADMIN` user account


## **STEP 1**: View sensitive data in your ATP database

In this step, you use SQL Developer Web to query sensitive data in your ATP database. You can access SQL Developer Web from the ATP Console.

- In a new browser window, enter the url to your region in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.

    - To access the Ashburn region, enter the following url: [https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/a/tenancy](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/a/tenancy).
    - To access the Frankfurt region, enter the following url:[https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/a/tenancy](https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/a/tenancy).

- If prompted, in the **Cloud Tenant** field on the **SIGN IN** page, enter your tenancy name, and then click **Continue**. Under **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**, enter your user credentials for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and then click **Sign In**.

  Note: If you are signed in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure on another tab, then you are not prompted to enter a tenancy name and can continue to the next step.


- Make sure the correct region is selected in your tenancy, for example, **US East (Ashburn)** or **Germany Central (Frankfurt)**.

  ![Select region in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](images/177413377.png)


- From the navigation menu, select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

  ![Select Autonomous Transaction Processing](images/177413380.png)


- Under **COMPARTMENT**, make sure that your compartment is selected. For example, the `dsu01` user should be able to access the `dsc01` compartment.

  ![Select compartment](images/177413383.png)


- In the list of databases, click the name of your database, for example, **atp01**.

  ![List of registered databases in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](images/177413385.png)


- Click **Service Console** to navigate to the **Autonomous Transaction Processing Console**.

  ![Service Console button](images/177413387.png)

  A new browser tab is opened called **Autonomous Transaction Processing | Overview**.

- If the browser prevents you from opening a pop-up window, click **Options**, and then select **Allow pop-ups for console.*region*.oraclecloud.com**.

- If you are prompted to log in to your ATP instance, enter the `ADMIN` user credentials.

- On the **Overview** page, click **Development**.

   ![Choose the type of insertion dialog box](images/177413398.png)

- View the SQL query on the worksheet.

   ![Worksheet tab showing EMPLOYEES table](images/177413399.png)

- On the toolbar, click the **Run Statement** button (green circle with a white arrow) to execute the query.

 ![Run Statement button on toolbar](images/177413401.png)

- Review the query results.

  - Data such as `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone_number`, `hire_date`, `job_id`, `salary`, and `manager_id` are considered sensitive data and should be masked if shared for non-production use, such as development and analytics.

  - Keep this tab open so that you can return to it later in step 4 when you view the masked data.

## **STEP 2**: Discover sensitive data by using Data Discovery

The Data Discovery wizard generates a sensitive data model that contains sensitive columns in your target database. When working in the wizard, you select sensitive types that you want to discover in your target database.

- Open a new tab in your browser, and enter one of the following URLs to the Oracle Data Safe service page in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

  - The url for the Ashburn region is [https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/data-safe/instances](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/data-safe/instances).

  - The url for the Frankfurt region is [https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/data-safe/instances](https://console.eu-frankfurt-1.oraclecloud.com/data-safe/instances).

- Click the **Service Console** button to access the Oracle Data Safe Console.

    ![Query results](images/click-service-console-from-overview-page.png)

  The **Home** tab is displayed.


- Access the Data Discovery wizard by clicking the **Data Discovery** tab.

- Scroll down the page to view the sensitive columns.

  - You can view sample data (if it's available for a sensitive column), column counts, and estimated data counts.

  - In particular, take a look at the sensitive columns that Data Discovery found in the `EMPLOYEES` table. Columns that do not have a check mark are called referential relationships. They are included because they have a relationship to another sensitive column and that relationship is defined in the database's data dictionary.
  - Also view the sample data provided to get an idea of what the sensitive data looks like. Your sample data may be different.

  ![Sensitive columns list](images/177413430.png)


- Scroll to the bottom of the page, and then click **Report**.

 ![Report button](images/data-discovery-report-button.png)


- View the **Data Discovery** report.

    - The chart compares sensitive categories. You can view totals of sensitive values, sensitive types, sensitive tables, and sensitive columns.
    - The table displays individual sensitive column names, sample data for the sensitive columns, column counts based on sensitive categories, and estimated data counts.

      ![Sensitive columns table](images/177413431.png)
