### Transparent Data Encryption

TDE Enables you to encrypt data so that only an authorized recipient can read it.

Use encryption to protect sensitive data in a potentially unprotected environment, such as data you placed on backup media that is sent to an off-site storage location. You can encrypt individual columns in a database table, or you can encrypt an entire tablespace.

After the data is encrypted, this data is transparently decrypted for authorized users or applications when they access this data. TDE helps protect data stored on media (also called data at rest) in the event that the storage media or data file is stolen.

Oracle Database uses authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to secure data in the database, but not in the operating system data files where data is stored. To protect these data files, Oracle Database provides Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). TDE encrypts sensitive data stored in data files. To prevent unauthorized decryption, TDE stores the encryption keys in a security module external to the database, called a keystore.

You can configure Oracle Key Vault as part of the TDE implementation. This enables you to centrally manage TDE keystores (called TDE wallets in Oracle Key Vault) in your enterprise. For example, you can upload a software keystore to Oracle Key Vault and then make the contents of this keystore available to other TDE-enabled databases.

**Benefits of Using Transparent Data Encryption**

- As a security administrator, you can be sure that sensitive data is encrypted and therefore safe in the event that the storage media or data file is stolen.

- Using TDE helps you address security-related regulatory compliance issues.

- You do not need to create auxiliary tables, triggers, or views to decrypt data for the authorized user or application. Data from tables is transparently decrypted for the database user and application. An application that processes sensitive data can use TDE to provide strong data encryption with little or no change to the application.

- Data is transparently decrypted for database users and applications that access this data. Database users and applications do not need to be aware that the data they are accessing is stored in encrypted form.

- You can encrypt data with zero downtime on production systems by using online table redefinition or you can encrypt it offline during maintenance periods. (See Oracle Database Administratorâ€™s Guide for more information about online table redefinition.)

- You do not need to modify your applications to handle the encrypted data. The database manages the data encryption and decryption.

- Oracle Database automates TDE master encryption key and keystore management operations. The user or application does not need to manage TDE master encryption keys.

### Data Redaction

Data Redaction enables you to mask (redact) data that is returned from queries issued by applications. We can also talk about Dynamic Data Masking.

You can redact column data by using one of the following methods:

- **Full redaction**
You redact all of the contents of the column data. The redacted value that is returned to the querying user depends on the data type of the column. For example, columns of the NUMBER data type are redacted with a zero (0) and character data types are redacted with a blank space.

- **Partial redaction**
You redact a portion of the column data. For example, you can redact most of a Social Security number with asterisks (*), except for the last 4 digits.

- **Regular expressions**
You can use regular expressions in both full and partial redaction. This enables you to redact data based on a search pattern for the data. For example, you can use regular expressions to redact specific phone numbers or email addresses in your data.

- **Random redaction**
The redacted data presented to the querying user appears as randomly generated values each time it is displayed, depending on the data type of the column.

- **No redaction**
This option enables you to test the internal operation of your redaction policies, with no effect on the results of queries against tables with policies defined on them. You can use this option to test the redaction policy definitions before applying them to a production environment.

Data Redaction performs the redaction at runtime, that is, the moment that the user tries to view the data. This functionality is ideally suited for dynamic production systems in which data constantly changes. While the data is being redacted, Oracle Database is able to process all of the data normally and to preserve the back-end referential integrity constraints. Data redaction can help you to comply with industry regulations such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

**Benefits of Using Oracle Data Redaction**

- You have different styles of redaction from which to choose.

- Because the data is redacted at runtime, Data Redaction is well suited to environments in which data is constantly changing.

- You can create the Data Redaction policies in one central location and easily manage them from there.

- The Data Redaction policies enable you to create a wide variety of function conditions based on SYS_CONTEXT values, which can be used at runtime to decide when the Data Redaction policies will apply to the results of the application user's query.

## Database Vault
Oracle Database Vault provides controls to prevent unauthorized privileged users from accessing sensitive data and to prevent unauthorized database changes.
The Oracle Database Vault security controls protect application data from unauthorized access, and comply with privacy and regulatory requirements.

![](./images/dv-concept.png " ")

You can deploy controls to block privileged account access to application data and control sensitive operations inside the database using trusted path authorization. Through the analysis of privileges and roles, you can increase the security of existing applications by using least privilege best practices. Oracle Database Vault secures existing database environments transparently, eliminating costly and time consuming application changes.

Oracle Database Vault enables you to create a set of components to manage security for your database instance.

These components are as follows:

- **Realms:** A realm is a protection zone inside the database where database schemas, objects, and roles can be secured. For example, you can secure a set of schemas, objects, and roles that are related to accounting, sales, or human resources. After you have secured these into a realm, you can use the realm to control the use of system and object privileges to specific accounts or roles. This enables you to provide fine-grained access controls for anyone who wants to use these schemas, objects, and roles.

- **Command rules:** A command rule is a special security policy that you can create to control how users can execute almost any SQL statement, including SELECT, ALTER SYSTEM, database definition language (DDL), and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Command rules must work with rule sets to determine whether the statement is allowed.

- **Factors:** A factor is a named variable or attribute, such as a user location, database IP address, or session user, which Oracle Database Vault can recognize and use as a trusted path. You can use factors in rules to control activities such as authorizing database accounts to connect to the database or the execution of a specific database command to restrict the visibility and manageability of data. Each factor can have one or more identities. An identity is the actual value of a factor. A factor can have several identities depending on the factor retrieval method or its identity mapping logic.

- **Rule sets:** A rule set is a collection of one or more rules that you can associate with a realm authorization, command rule, factor assignment, or secure application role. The rule set evaluates to true or false based on the evaluation of each rule it contains and the evaluation type (All True or Any True). The rule within a rule set is a PL/SQL expression that evaluates to true or false. You can have the same rule in multiple rule sets.

- **Secure application roles:** A secure application role is a special Oracle Database role that can be enabled based on the evaluation of an Oracle Database Vault rule set.

To augment these components, Oracle Database Vault provides a set of PL/SQL interfaces and packages.

In general, the first step you take is to create a realm composed of the database schemas or database objects that you want to secure. You can further secure the realm by creating rules, command rules, factors, identities, rule sets, and secure application roles. In addition, you can run reports on the activities these components monitor and protect.

**Benefits of using Database Vault**

- Addresses compliance regulations to security awareness
- Protects privileged user accounts from many security breaches and data steal, both external and internal
- Helps you design flexible security policies for your database
- Addresses Database consolidation and cloud environments concerns to reduce cost and reduce exposure sensitive application data to those without a true need-to-know
- Works in a Multitenant Environment increasing security for consolidation

## Label Security
Oracle Label Security controls the display of individual table rows using labels that are assigned to specific individual table rows and application users.

![](./images/ols-concept.png " ")

Oracle Label Security works by comparing the row label with a user's label authorizations to enable you to easily restrict sensitive information to only authorized users. This way, users with different authorization levels (for example, managers and sales representatives) can have access to specific rows of data in a table. You can apply Oracle Label Security policies to one or more application tables. The design of Oracle Label Security is similar to Oracle Virtual Private Database (VPD). However, unlike VPD, Oracle Label Security provides the access mediation functions, data dictionary tables, and policy-based architecture out of the box, eliminating customized coding and providing a consistent label based access control model that can be used by multiple applications.

Oracle Label Security is based on multi-level security (MLS) requirements that are found in government and defense organizations.

Oracle Label Security software is installed by default, but not automatically enabled. You can enable Oracle Label Security in either SQL*Plus or by using the Oracle Database Configuration Assistant (DBCA). The default administrator for Oracle Label Security is the user LBACSYS. To manage Oracle Label Security, you can use either a set of PL/SQL packages and standalone functions at the command-line level or Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. To find information about Oracle Label Security policies, you can query ALL_SA_*, DBA_SA_*, or USER_SA_* data dictionary views.

An Oracle Label Security policy has a standard set of components.

These components are as follows:

- **Labels:** Labels for data and users, along with authorizations for users and program units, govern access to specified protected objects. Labels are composed of the following:

    - **Levels:** Levels indicate the type of sensitivity that you want to assign to the row (for example, SENSITIVE or HIGHLY SENSITIVE). Levels are mandatory.
    - **Compartments (Optional):** Data can have the same level (for example, Public, Confidential and Secret), but can belong to different projects inside a company (for example, ACME Merger and IT Security). Compartments represent the projects in this example that help define more precise access controls. They are most often used in government environments.
    - **Groups (Optional):** Groups identify organizations owning or accessing the data (for example, UK, US, Asia, Europe). Groups are used both in commercial and government environments, and frequently used in place of compartments due to their flexibility.

- **Policy:** A policy is a name associated with these labels, rules, authorizations, and protected tables.

**Benefits of using Oracle Label Security**

Oracle Label Security provides several benefits for controlling row level management.

- It enables row level data classification and provides out-of-the-box access mediation based on the data classification and the user label authorization or security clearance.
- It enables you to assign label authorizations or security clearances to both database users and application users.
- It provides both APIs and a graphical user interface for defining and storing data classification labels and user label authorizations.
- It integrates with Oracle Database Vault and Oracle Advanced Security Data Redaction, enabling security clearances to be use in both Database Vault command rules and Data Redaction policy definitions.
